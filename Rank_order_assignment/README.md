## ## Files:
1. 1. RankOrder_Func.py contains the function that implements the standard Hungarian method to solve the rank order problem. Not working very good after adding the constraint that each doctor can have capacity more than 1.
   2. RankOrder_LIP.pyu contains the function that implements the Linerar Integer Problem method to solve the rank order problem. Works very well with the simple test case, and seems to be easy to add additional constraints.
